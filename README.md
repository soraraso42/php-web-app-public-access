# PHP Web App: Deposit Calculator

## Overview
This is an interactive web application built with **PHP** to offer users services like deposit calculation and appointment booking. The application emphasizes **server-side rendering and validation** while ensuring data privacy through PHP sessions. Users can calculate future deposits based on their principal input and years of deposit, and also book appointments either by phone or email.

The app applies **server-side validation** using regular expressions to ensure proper formatting of user input (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, and postal codes). It also offers meaningful feedback to users when errors occur, without requiring them to re-enter correctly entered data.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP**: Used to render dynamic pages and handle server-side logic.
- **Sessions**: Temporary storage of user data to ensure privacy and secure handling of personal information, preventing one user from accessing anotherâ€™s data.
- **Routing**: Routing different requests through predefined PHP endpoints (like `/CustomerInformation.php`, `/DepositCalculator.php`) to handle specific actions.
- **Regular Expressions**: For validating input fields such as postal code, phone number, and email.
- **JavaScript**: Used for simple interactivity, like toggling between phone and email contact options during appointment booking.


## Features

- **Terms of Service (ToS) Agreement**: Users must agree to the ToS before using any features of the app.
- **Deposit Forecast Calculator**: Calculates deposit growth based on user input (principal amount and number of years).
- **Appointment Booking**: Users can choose to book an appointment either via phone or email, with additional features for selecting timeslots for phone appointments.
- **Error Handling and Feedback**: Server-side validation ensures accurate data input, and users receive meaningful error messages for invalid fields (e.g., incorrect phone number format).
  

## Workflow

1. **User Session Handling**: Sessions (`$_SESSION`) are used to store user data temporarily. After booking an appointment or submitting valid inputs, the session ensures that no data persists beyond the intended scope of use.
2. **Form Validation**: PHP validates user inputs for each form. Users see feedback immediately if their input is invalid.
   - Postal code, phone, and email are validated using **regular expressions**.
   - For example, the postal code is validated using the regex `/[a-z][0-9][a-z]\s*[0-9][a-z][0-9]/i`.
   - Phone number validation checks for the format `nnn-nnn-nnnn` using `/^[1-9][0-9]{2}-[1-9][0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$/`.
3. **Conditional Redirection**: Based on user choices (e.g., contact via phone or email), the app redirects users to the appropriate pages (`DepositCalculator.php` or `ContactTime.php`).
4. **Deposit Calculation**: Users can calculate future deposits based on a starting principal and the number of years. Interest is applied and results displayed in a table.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Session**: Learned how to use user sessions to ensure that session data is isolated for each user. During session data persistence improves UX, while after session clearing ensures data privacy.
- **Dynamic Page Rendering**: Rendering dynamic pages based on user input required understanding how to preserve input across form submissions using session variables. Reusable page components are even more significant with scalable projects.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Frontend**: Improve the UI using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for better form styling and user experience.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement stronger session management techniques like session timeouts and CSRF protection.
